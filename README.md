# Smoosic

Smoosic is a simple (?) but fully-functional-aspirant editor for music written in javascript.  
The goal is to be
easily embeddable and modifyable.  All that is required to use Smoosic in your own projects is to create the editor in a DOM.   It uses VexFlow
project from [GitHub Vex Flow](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow) for rendering

You can see smoosic in action here:

If you want to use it, a good place to start are the unit tests.  They are here:
