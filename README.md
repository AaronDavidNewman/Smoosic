# Big News:
Smoosic has moved.  Please see the new repositories [here](https://github.com/Smoosic).

# What is going on, Smoosic?
I wanted to create a Smoosic organization, independent of my own personal github repository.  I'd like to involve the global community of musicians and developers, and I thought that would be easier as an independent project.  Also, the more people contribute to this, the more it becomes a we and not a me, and the new organizational structure will reflect that.

So there will be no more updates to this repository.  Please join us in the new place.
