# Smoosic

Smoosic is a simple (?) but fully-functional-aspirant editor for music written in javascript.  
The goal is to be
easily embeddable and modifyable.  All that is required to use Smoosic in your own projects is to create the editor in a DOM.   It uses VexFlow
project from [GitHub Vex Flow](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow) for rendering

[Editor Commands and Key Mappings](https://aarondavidnewman.github.io/Smoosic/build/docs/helpfile.html)

There is a list of 
[available and not-yet-available functions:](https://aarondavidnewman.github.io/Smoosic/build/docs/SMOFeatures.html).  A 0 means the function is not available.  Some features are available in the tests before they are incorporated into the UI.  A few functions are UI-only and don't have a test.  If it is not in the spreadsheet at all, it means I haven't thought of it yet.
